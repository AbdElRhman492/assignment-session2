Research Notes — HTML Entities

What are HTML entities?
- HTML entities are special codes that represent characters that either:
  1) have a reserved meaning in HTML syntax, or
  2) are not easily typed on a keyboard, or
  3) belong to Unicode characters that might not render reliably across all contexts.
- They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;), e.g., &amp;copy;.

Why and when to use them:
1) To escape reserved characters so they are shown as text instead of being parsed as HTML:
   - &lt; for <
   - &gt; for >
   - &amp; for &
2) To display typographic punctuation and symbols:
   - &copy; (©), &reg; (®), &trade; (™)
   - &quot; (") and &apos; (') for quotes in certain contexts
   - &ndash; (–), &mdash; (—)
3) To control whitespace:
   - &nbsp; for a non‑breaking space (prevents a line break between words)
4) To include non‑ASCII letters or special symbols if keyboard/input is limited:
   - &euro; (€), &pound; (£), &yen; (¥)
   - &alpha; (α), &beta; (β), &pi; (π)

Common examples:
- Show code safely: &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;Hello &amp; welcome!&lt;/div&gt;
- Keep words together: Rock&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Roll
- Copyright footer: &copy; 2025 Your Name

Notes:
- Modern HTML supports UTF‑8, so many characters can be typed directly, but escaping reserved characters (&, <, >) is still required in text, attributes, and when embedding code.
- For readability, use named entities (e.g., &copy;) when available; otherwise use numeric entities like &#169;.
